--- abstract

In order to improve the readability of RFCs while supporting their archivability, the definitive version of the RFC Series transitioned from plain-text ASCII to XML using the RFCXML vocabulary; different publication versions are rendered from that base document.
This document is the framework that provides the problem statement, lays out a road map of the documents that capture the specific requirements, and describes how RFCs are published.

This document obsoletes RFC 7990 and makes many significant changes to that document.
It also updates the stability policy in RFC 9280.

This draft is part of the RFC Series Working Group (RSWG); see <https://datatracker.ietf.org/edwg/rswg/documents/>.
There is a repository for this draft at <https://github.com/paulehoffman/draft-rswg-rfc7990-updates>.
Issues can be raised there, but probably should be on the mailing list instead.

# Introduction

"RFC Series Format Requirements and Future Development" {{RFC6949}} discussed the need to improve the display of items such as author names and artwork in RFCs as well as the need to improve the ability of RFCs to be displayed properly on various devices.
Based on the discussions with communities of interest, such as the IETF, the RFC Series Editor decided to explore a change to the format of the Series.
This document serves as the framework that describes the problems that were solved and summarizes the documents created to date that capture the specific requirements for each aspect of the change in format.

This document is concerned with the production of RFCs, focusing on the published formats.
It does not address any changes to the processes each stream uses to develop and review their submissions (specifically, how Internet-Drafts will be developed).
While I-Ds have a similar set of issues and concerns, directly addressing those issues for I-Ds will be discussed within each document stream.

The details described in this document are expected to continue to change over time as the community and the RPC gains further experience with the components of the framework.

Implementors of those components are advised to avoid assuming that all such changes will be backwards-compatible.

## Changes to RFC 7990

{{RFC7990}} defined a framework for how RFCs would be published after that document was published, including new formats and a new "canonical format" for archiving RFCs.
It talked about "the XML file" as if there will only be one XML file for an RFC because this was the expectation at the time {{RFC7990}} was published.
It also talked about "publication formats" as the versions of HTML, text, and PDF versions derived from the definitive version.

After extensive experience with publishing RFCs in the RFCXML format {{RFC7991}}, it has been decided that an RFC's XML file can be updated for narrowly limited purposes.
This document changes {{RFC7990}} in significant ways:

- It changes the phrase "canonical format" to "definitive version" and defines the use of the definitive version in the series.
- It changes the phrase "publication format" to "publication versions" and defines the use of the publication versions in the series.
- It changes the phrase "xml2rfc version 3" to "RFCXML".
- It defines a policy governing how the RFCXML format changes.
- It updates {{RFC7995}} and {{RFC8153}} by changing the requirement from using the PDF/A-3 standard to using the PDF/A standard,
and by dropping the requirement that the XML be embedded in the PDF publication version.
- It defines a policy for when the definitive version of an RFC can be updated and older versions archived.
- It defines a policy for when the publication versions of an RFC can be updated and older versions archived.
- It changes the name of the body that publishes RFCs from "RFC Editor" to "RPC"
- It changes the use of JavaScript in HTML to be fully supported as long as it doesn't change the text

Historical text from {{RFC7990}} such as Section 2 ("Problem Statement"), Section 4 ("Overview of the Decision-Making Process"), and Section 10 ("Transition Plan") are not copied to this document.

## Changes to RFC 9280 {#changes-to-9280}

Section 7.6 of {{RFC9280}} currently says:

> Once published, RFC Series documents are not changed.

This document replaces that sentence with:

> Once published, RFC Series documents may be re-issued, but the semantic content of published documents shall be preserved.

This document also creates a new policy that would exist in Section 7 of {{RFC9280}}:

> 7.8.  Consistency
> 
> The series as a whole is consistently presented.
RFCs are copyedited, formatted, published, and may be reissued to maintain a consistent presentation across the Series.

{{updating}} and {{pub-versions}} in this document are based on this updated policy in {{RFC9280}}.

## Key Changes from the Earlier RFC Process

The first RFC to be published using the group of RFCs described in {{RFC7990}} was {{RFC8650}}, published in November 2019.
In the time since then, all published RFCs have followed the general plan from {{RFC7990}}.

At the highest level, the changes that {{RFC7990}} made to the RFC format involved breaking away from solely ASCII ({{RFC20}}) plain text and moving to a definitive version that includes all the information required for rendering a document into a wide variety of publication versions.
The RPC became responsible for more than just the plain-text file and a PDF rendering that was created from the plain-text at the time of publication; the RPC now creates several different formats in order to meet the diverse requirements of the community.

The final XML file produced by the RPC is the definitive version for RFCs; it holds all the information intended for an RFC.
Additional file formats (HTML, PDF, and plain text) are also published by the RPC.
The file formats are described in {{pub-versions}} and fully specified in other RFCs.


# Definitive Version of an RFC

The definitive version produced by the RPC is the version that holds all the information intended for an RFC.
The RPC may change the definitive version of an RFC over time (that is, change the XML file), as described in {{updating}}.
See {{RFC7991}} for the original complete description of the RFCXML syntax and semantics.

The XML may contain SVG line art, as originally described in {{RFC7996}}.
That SVG will also appear in the HTML and PDF publication versions.
The XML may contain non-ASCII characters, as originally described in {{RFC7997}}.
These characters will appear in all the publication versions.

The published XML file must contain all information necessary to render a variety of formats; any question about what was intended in the publication will be answered from this file.
It is self-contained with all the information known at publication time.
For instance, all features that reference externally defined input are expanded.
It does not contain src attributes for &lt;artwork> or &lt;sourcecode> elements.
It  does not contain comments or processing instructions.

## Updating the Definitive Version of an RFC {#updating}

RFCs may be re-issued, as described in {{changes-to-9280}}.
Such changes will seek to preserve the semantics expressed in the original RFC while maintaining consistency across the series.
Reasons for such changes include updates to the RFCXML schema, errors discovered in the XML, and changes to the tooling used to generate the publication versions of the definitive XML version of the RFC.
The RPC will keep a public record of when it re-issues any RFC, and give a short description of its reasoning for each change.

## Expected Updates to XMLRFC

It is anticipated that the syntax and semantics in {{RFC7991}} will be updated.
Updates to the RFCXML specification that are applied to existing RFCs should preserve to the greatest extent possible the semantics expressed in the original RFC.
The goal of limiting changes only to syntax is to preserve the semantic meaning encoded in the published document.

This policy does not require that updates to RFCXML avoid all risk of introducing semantic changes to existing RFCs.
Instead, it only requires that such updates consider the potential for semantic changes, take steps to understand the risk of a semantic change (either deliberate or inadvertent), and to limit those risks.


# Publication Versions {#pub-versions}

The RPC is permitted but not required to re-issue publication versions of an RFC, as described in {{changes-to-9280}}.
In deciding whether to update the publication versions of an RFC, the RPC will take into account both the risk of semantic changes and consistency of the series.

XML format errors and better design choices have been discovered by the community since the first RFCs were published using the RFCXML format.
When the XML in a definitive version changes, the publication versions may change, even if this might not result in observable differences.
Similarly, as production tools change, publication versions may be regenerated to ensure a consistent presentation across the series.

## HTML

{{RFC7992}} describes the semantic HTML produced by the RPC from the XML files.
The HTML file is rendered from the XML file; it is not derived from the plain-text publication version.
The body of the document uses a subset of HTML.

The documents include Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for default visual presentation; the CSS can be overwritten by a local CSS file.
The allowed CSS is described in {{RFC7993}}.

JavaScript in the HTML publication version is supported.
The JavaScript in the HTML is not permitted to change the meaning of the RFC.
The JavaScript in the HTML may add text that provides post-publication metadata or pointers. 

## PDF

{{RFC7995}} describes the different versions of PDF is offered, with a recommendation of what PDF standard should apply to RFCs.

The PDF file is rendered from the XML file or from the HTML publication version; it is not derived from the plain-text publication version.

The PDF publication version conforms to the PDF standard.
The RPC can decide which PDF standard will be supported after consultation with the community.

This document updates {{RFC7995}} and {{RFC8153}} by changing the requirement from the RPC use PDF/A-3 standard to instead using the PDF/A standard,
and by dropping the requirement that the XML be embedded in the PDF publication version.
Other parts of {{RFC8153}}, particularly the need to archive metadata about RFCs, are not changed.

The PDF looks more like the HTML publication version than the plain-text publication version.
The PDF includes a rich set of tags and metadata within the document.

## Plain Text

{{RFC7994}} describes the details of the plain-text format.
In particular, it focuses on what changed from the earlier plain-text format for publishing RFCs.


# Archived Documents

The RPC will keep archived set of all definitive versions of RFCs as well as archived sets of the publication versions for an RFC that were previously published.
These archived sets must be available using the same access methods as for the XML and the published publication versions.
Every archived set shall record the date that a document was created or revised.

When the RPC archives documents, it does so in a manner that allows them to be found by people who want the historical (as compared to current) versions of those files.

This document does not specify how archives are maintained or how archived documents might be located or identified.
The methods for storage and access will be determined by the RPC in consultation with the technical community.

{{archive-advice}} gives some non-normative advice created by the RSWG.


# IANA Considerations

This document has no IANA considerations.


# Security Considerations

Changing the format for RFCs involves modifying a great number of components to publication.
Understanding those changes and the implications for the entire tool chain is critical so as to avoid unintended consequences that would allow unintended changes to text.
Unintended changes to text could in turn corrupt a standard, practice, or critical piece of information about a protocol.

The RSWG is responsible for managing the risk of semantic changes that would affect the interpretation of existing and future RFCs.
Changes to content that has security implications would have security-relevant consequences.

# Advice on Regenerating Publication Versions {#archive-advice}

This document does not include specific guidance regarding the generation of publication versions from the RFCXML source for the definitive version of an RFC.
Decisions about how to maintain publication versions are not a matter governed by policy as specified in {{RFC9280}}.
This appendix contains advice and considerations for the process of regeneration that came out of discussions of the policy changes in this document.

Changes to the RFCXML for existing RFCs might result in changes to the documents rendered from that XML.
At the same time, the tools used to generate renderings are under active maintenance.
Making it possible for a fresh rendering to replace existing publication versions is a goal supported by the policy changes in this document.

This creates a risk that a rerendered documents change in unexpected ways when they are regenerated.
This risk of unintentional change can be managed by implementing validation processes:

- Tools can be continuously checked by producing renderings for existing RFCs.
Any change in the rendered document can then be compared with previous outputs and validated.
This will ensure that changes in tooling are deliberate and understood.

- When a change to the XML format occurs, rendered documents can be regenerated and any change in the rendering can be validated.

Validation should be aided by automated tooling that is able to disregard inconsequential changes in renderings, like changes in timestamps and other annotations.
Validation of tooling can be continuous, for which automation is essential.

The decision to make renderings available as the publication versions for an RFC is a decision that can be made on a case-by-case basis.
Making fresh renderings available more often could mean a greater risk that people seeking to read RFCs will obtain a copy that contains accidental errors.
However, errors in publication versions might persist if they are not replaced as tool quality and reliability improves.

Old copies of replaced publication versions will be retained to provide the ability to isolate changes and understand the evolution of documents.
